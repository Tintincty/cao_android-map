Teris
Use Python to implement a Tetris game,

use a two-dimensional array to define the block,

and implement the position change of the block in a rotating manner

Determine whether the block can be "docked". 

When "docked" occurs, the block can no longer fall.

At this time, draw the non-empty points of the block onto the game area

And calculate whether a row is completely filled, if it is completely filled, eliminate
